#Assignment 3
Directions

Write a shell script, where the file is named Assignment3.sh, for bash or zsh (it does not matter which).
The script must accept a white space separated list of integers as arguments (after the command, such as ./Assignment3.sh 1 5 15 22).
For each item in the list, the script must check whether the integer is divisible by 3, 5, or both 3 and 5 (so 15).
If the number is divisible by 3, then print "fizz".
If the number is divisible by 5, then print "buzz".
If the number is divisible by 15, then print "fizzybuzzy".
If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, then print the number.

Try to use the shebang "#!/usr/bin/env zsh" or "#!/usr/bin/env bash", although you might have to change that for your system.

Turn in the script, again named Assignment3.sh, with no formatting, by uploading it to canvas. I will run the scripts in my shell on a test suite of integer lists to decide on your grade.

Hint 1:
To check if a number is divisible by 9, you would use the modulo operator "%" and check whether the result was equal to 0 or not.
For example, if we were checking an integer stored in the variable num, we would write $num%9==0.

Hint 2: 
To get the first argument passed to a command/script we use "$1", to get the second argument we use "$2". To get all of the arguments passed to a script we use "$@". 

Hint 3:
To evaluate math expressions, place them between two parentheses, for example ((2+4)), and yes, modulo is math.

Hint 4:
elif will help
