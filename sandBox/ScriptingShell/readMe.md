#Shell Scripting
This is a project to explore shell scripting


##Description of files
ifElseExample.sh-- basic script for conditions
checkFileExists.sh-- generalizes if else into a command that can be run
simpleScript1.sh-- more complicated example with for loop special characters and condition; as well as some string substitution


##Notes
For execute permissions, might need chmod 754 XXX, where XXX is for script name
