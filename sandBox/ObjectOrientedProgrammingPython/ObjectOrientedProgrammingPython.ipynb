    "# Objects \n",
    "\n",
    "Object oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm for how to talk to your computer. What you do is that you teach it concepts, classes of objects. You have already been doing a bit of this. Lists are classes of objects, etc; also known as types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes of objects are often related to each other, so we might have a class of an object, like a sentence object in a natural language processing project, but then there is a sub-type of that class, that specifically holds information on human rights, or rebel groups, for particular applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I want to carefully walk through the examples given in DSFS. Classes have a number of different parts, but they are powerful tools for organizing your code, being able to re-use your hard work across projects, and clearly communicating your intentions to your future self and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining a class\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, we **define** a class. This is like defining a function, but it more general. We are priming our python interpreter/computer to be able to understand a new concept we are going to teach it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to teach it is that you are a) going to be communicating a new concept (it can be related to other concepts) and b) what is the name of this concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the book, I will incrementally build up the code, overwriting the `CountingClicker` object class each time"

    "Here we used `class` to signal this is a new class of object we are teaching; and we named it `CountingClicker`. We also included a short docstring, but to let you know that this is the best practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## methods\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is not really useful if it does not do anything. **Methods** are functions, also known as member functions, that belong to the class. They are functions that process information within the object. Examples should make this more clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first method that every object should have is a **constructor** method. This is how you construct **instances** of the object. This is a reallly crucial distinction. The class is just a **type** of object, it is not actually an instance of the object. A **list** is a n object `a = [1, 2,]` is an instance of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of conventions in constructors that are important. \n",
    "\n",
    "- First, you call the main constructor method `__init__` the syntax for methods is just like functions (in fact methods are just functions that are members of a certain class). The double underscores are actually important. This is known as a dunder (double under), and are known as special or magic in different corners of the Python-verse. What is important is that these methods are `private` or `non-public`. This communicates to users that they are not supposed to call these methods directly. They are going to be used by Python behind the scenes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Second, the first argument is `self` this will refer to the object itself and will allow us to use the `myObj.doSomething()` notation effectively.\n"
